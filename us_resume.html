                        </h2>
                        <div><p>With years of experience as a programmer, I have come to know the digital world from the inside out. As a Product Owner / Product & Team Manager, my focus is on improving software and guiding IT teams worldwide, with special emphasis on India. It is fascinating how technology enables us to bridge distances and embrace cultural differences while working together on innovative solutions.</p><p>This journey has also led me to another passion: sustainability in IT and beyond. A notable project is my Energy Prices platform, where I used Digital Ocean servers with Debian, along with various Docker containers hosting Linux-based operating systems and Python environments. This API-based system provides daily gas and hourly electricity prices to over 15,000 users. I personally handled all configurations and troubleshooting to ensure optimal performance and reliability of these systems. I strongly believe that we can utilize our technical expertise not only to develop more efficient software and hardware but also to guide companies towards a greener future. This is where one of my passions lies: merging technology and environmental initiatives to make a positive impact.</p><p>Through my experiences, I have learned that success is not only measured in lines of code or project deadlines but also in the positive changes we bring about. From optimizing business and team processes to reducing a company's ecological footprint, it is a challenging but immensely rewarding balance.</p><p>At heart, I am a bridge-builder â€“ between teams and clients, with steps towards a more sustainable future. Together, we can harness the power of IT to transform not only our businesses but also our world.</p></div>

                                    In early 2021, when energy prices were rising, I discovered the benefits of negative electricity prices with a friend. This led to ePrices, a platform that monitors dynamic energy prices. I wrote a Python script that alerts via Telegram when prices are low. What started as a personal project grew into a service for thousands of users. With Docker and Digital Ocean, I ensured scalability and stability. By the end of 2023, ePrices reached 13,000 users.
